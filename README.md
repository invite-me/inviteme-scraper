Selenium-based webscraper. The last time when I wrote bots with selenium, I found it easy and really powerful. That was 4 years ago.... and selenium is even more powerful. But my coding skills aren't.
I have wrote this app to run it once so I hope you won't have to use it anyway.

Before a Prom night I was in charge of technical side. I wasn't organiser and I really didn't want to play "a big Mr. manager" role so finding and organising teachers' and students' emails was a minior problem. I have had only first and last names of participants and I have used MS Teams feature to scrap emails. When you type first and last name of user in Teams' organization, you will get a dropdown list with user object. That object contains email addres "ID" attached to the micrsoft domain. I have used this hack to get all participants organization e-mail addreses.
